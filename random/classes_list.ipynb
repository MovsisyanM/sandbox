    "This course reviews a range of econometric methods that can be used for supporting business and management. Starting with an introduction to business and management decisions that need data analysis, the course will proceed to advanced econometric methods for addressing specific problems stemming either from the nature of the data generation process or from the relationships being examined. The course will develop econometric skills in several ways. First, the course will review numerous econometric models and in each case discuss the type of problems the model is suited for, how to test hypotheses, and the shortcomings of various models. Second, students will be asked to prepare 2 presentations that will introduce a specific problem that a decision maker (manager) is facing (can face) and provide recommendations based on available data and econometric analysis. Third, to assist in the development of data management, modeling, analysis, and interpretative skills, students will use Stata to analyze data. Students will be graded based on group and individual presentations, midterm exam, final report, and class participation. This is a 3 unit elective course, with three hours of instructor-led discussion per week.\n",

The course structure follows the evolutionary process of a new venture: Idea assessment, organization formation, capitalization, growth, and exit. The course integrates much of what students have learned in their first year courses and challenges them to apply the newly acquired knowledge and tools to a real business situation. The course combines theoretical and applied learning, including lectures, guest speakers, traditional case studies and “live” new venture projects. Under the guidance of the faculty and with the support of mentors, student teams take a multidisciplinary approach to the preparation and presentation of a business plan for a real new venture. In the process, students are expected to make difficult business choices with less than perfect information, dealing with ambiguity and uncertainty. Students conclude their project with an oral presentation in addition to a full written report.\n",

    "Much of modern financial economics works with models in which agents are rational and arbitrageurs can fix any mis-pricing. Behavioral Financial Economics is the area of finance which relaxes both of these assumptions. Behavioral models usually have two building blocks: limits to arbitrage, which make it difficult for rational traders to undo the dislocations caused by less rational traders; and psychology, which catalogues the kinds of deviations from full rationality we might expect to see. We discuss these two topics, and then consider a number of applications such as asset pricing (the aggregate stock market and the cross-section of average returns) or individual investor portfolio choice and trading behavior.\n",

Three basic blocks of the concept are presented step by step: economic development, social change and conservation of environment. The course will begin with reviewing the current state of the planet, exploring the inception of the SD concept, and international efforts undertaken in the mainstream of this concept since early 70s. Then the focus will shift to economic policy and discuss economic growth vs. economic development. The course will then move to the issues of social change, particularly addressing poverty and hunger, income inequality, education and human capital as factors of SD. Next the instructor will turn to the issues of overpopulation, urbanization, scarcity of natural resources and impact of these factors on SD.\n",

Individual, international, and national developments require the protection of human rights; therefore, there is no security without the protection of human rights. Development requires respect for human rights, and respect for human rights prevents conflicts. Using the concept of human rights in the security sector helps actors like the police and the military to understand their role as duty-bearers in providing security as a public service to the people – the rights-holders. Security sector and human rights are also closely associated with democracy and the rule of law. The course will introduce such specific areas as: border security and human rights; conditions of detention and imprisonment, prohibition of torture; ill-treatment prevention issues by police and in police detention facilities; this will also include other law-enforcement bodies; right to a fair trial, etc.\n",

    " \n",
    "\n",
    "This course provides a multifaceted comparative study of nationalism through a primarily theoretical lens. Given its central role in building both individual identity and collective belonging, the current debates on nationalism as pivotal in shaping modern world politics are as relevant as ever. The course starts by defining the main elements and features of nations which serves to contextualize the discourse on nationalism. This will then be followed by a systematic study of the main paradigms of nations and nationalism including the primordialism, perennialism, modernism, and ethno-symbolism paradigms. The course will highlight and compare the most prominent explanations of nationalism and identity-formation. This deep theoretical foundation will help in framing the discourse on nationalism in relation to conflict, paying special attention to the intricate relationship between self-determination, nationalism, and secession.  The final portion of the course will explore normative inquiry of nationalism by asking the all-important question: is nationalism compatible with liberalism? To provide an all-encompassing and balanced study, the course pairs all theoretical discussions with comparative case studies of rising nationalisms across the globe.\n",

    "\n",
    "This writing-intensive course covers various issues pertaining to conflicts of international character in XXI century and is aimed at improving the understanding of the universe of state actors, international organizations and their interests, the environment of modern conflicts and possibilities of conflict resolution in the frameworks of international organisations and through ad hoc ‘coalitions of the willing’. The issues of global governance will be explored to understand international mechanisms that are currently employed for conflict prevention and resolution, such as the role of humanitarian and human rights organizations and international tribunals, in parallel with more conventional means such as peacekeeping missions or third-party mediation. To that end, we will enter the corridors of the United Nations and regional organizations in order to see how they deal with those crises in places such as Libya, Mali, Syria, Ukraine, Nagorno Karabakh, DRC or Colombia, and why, inter alia, criminal prosecution of masterminds of atrocity crimes in one place is not necessarily the right path to pursue in another.\n",

    "Foreign Policy Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "This graduate-level elective course will focus on how states, big and small, formulate and implement their foreign policies, both in theoretical and practical terms. We will explore the theoretical foundations of foreign policy-making in both legal and political domains, followed by process-oriented analysis of foreign policy decision-making in select countries and how that affects the conduct of diplomacy. To that end, various decision-making models (rational state actor, bureaucratic/organizational, institutional, societal etc) will be discussed and assessed from the perspective of modern challenges contemporary states are facing – especially in the context of growing mass participation in politics and acceleration of news cycles. Naturally, we shall venture to understand the role of key players (government agencies, political parties, leaders, etc) and secondary participants (NGOs, private interest groups, corporations, etc) in the making of foreign policy, as well as their interactions in-between. To the extent possible, this course will be based on domestic political, legal and institutional factors, leaving external triggers in the background, since those are well discussed in other courses too, in order to have a clear focus and learning objectives.BREAKOne of the core assumptions the course is built on is that the precise model of decision-making process at play significantly impacts the particular course of action eventually chosen. The environment of foreign policy-making process – predominantly focusing on domestic political developments (in democratic, authoritarian and hybrid regimes) – will be assessed case-by-case, as well as in comparative perspective, to give a big-picture understanding of complex challenges modern states are struggling with in foreign policy making process.\n",

How should society address the scarcity of human organs for transplantation? Should people be allowed to buy and sell organs? If cloning of humans were possible would it be justified? What are stem cells and why are their uses controversial? Should genetic intervention by parents permitted? Is there or should there be a right to healthcare?

Certain notions, picked up from the case law of the European Court of Human rights (e.g. Perincek), the U.S. Supreme Court (Cohen v. California, Citizens United, etc) and ad hoc international tribunals (RTLM radio case, ICTR) will be reflected upon to improve student understanding of legal doctrine development and its effects on policies and politics.

The course will address certain globalization aspects such as ‘push and pull’ as well as pluses and minuses, affecting states and populations. It will particularly deal with structure and processes of current dynamics in international affairs such as financial inequality, migration, statism vs. liberal structures, and will explore the current provocations created by populism and millennial socialism.   The course disciplines will include political economy and political science, exploring a number of international relations theories such as realism, liberalism, constructivism, structuralism and post-structuralism. Attention will be give to the special challenges of small states as they move forward with development strategies.   The course will include governing in a volatile global economy, particularly one embedded in current shocks affecting income, labor markets, law and normative behavior, migration and interdependence of global interactions such as trade and performance of transnational institutions.   The course will be conducted in a seminar format. This requires substantial discussion rather than lecture. Readings will prepare the participants for issues to be explored. The instructor will act as a discussion leader. The students will carry responsibility for proposing correlations and causations about which one can hypothesize. Students will report the significant ingredients of the readings and others will be prepared to react to issues presented and raise appropriate questions. One or two guest speakers will be invited to contribute to the seminar.   Course evaluation will include short concept papers; continued oral presentations and contributions; final term paper ability to analyze and critique other student presentations.\n",

    "About 70 percent of all languages currently spoken on Earth occur in approximately one-fourth of the planet’s land area (excluding Antarctica) that is designated as a Biodiversity Hotspot or High Biodiversity Wilderness Area. As is the case with species occurring in the biodiversity regions, many of the languages spoken in the Hotspots and High Biodiversity Wilderness Areas are unique to individual regions, thereby marking the sole opportunities to maintain them. Moreover, many of the languages occurring in these regions are spoken by small numbers of people indicating that much of the linguistic diversity (and, by implication, cultural diversity) currently present in biodiversity regions is in danger of disappearing in the foreseeable future due to the high vulnerability of small groups to changes in their cultural systems and environments amid rapid globalization.” From: http://users.ox.ac.uk/~romaine/lingbiodiversity.html. Through readings, class materials and lectures, this course introduces students to Earth’s Biodiversity Hotspots and the linguistic and cultural groups that live in these hotspots.

Specific communication models are considered by placing constraints on the sets of messages, senders, and receivers, on the network’s topology, on the rules that govern message transmissions, and on the amount of information about the network known to individual network members. One goal is to design network structures which are inexpensive to construct yet allow fast communication. The second major goal is to design efficient communication algorithms for commonly used networks under different communication models. These require knowledge of graph theory, combinatorics, and design and analysis of algorithms. Instructor-led discussions and problem sets.\n",

    "Western artistic production and criticism has been monopolized by male heterosexual spectatorship. The result has been an artistic tradition beset with gendered perceptions and a discourse whose objective is to regulate and marginalize the voices of “others.” It is therefore necessary to reread the texts and look afresh at art to expose the fallacies. Topics to be discussed include: mythmaking, the formulation of sexual ideals of beauty, spectatorship and the gaze, feminist theory, gay studies, naked/nude, and constructs of pornography. Exams and papers foster a critical mindset and a sensitivity to biases latent within the realm of art. Instructor-led class may include lectures, discussions, case studies, readings, group work.

    "This course is a survey of the literature on key determinants of development “Development” at the statelevel and “development” at the project level. We begin by considering some of the factors that drive state development, including economic growth, poverty reduction, social inequality, etc. We study different development models most popular in different periods of time, and then move on to the analysis of state policies in health and education, population and migration, and the linkages between investments in human capital and economic growth. The course then moves on to other key topics in international development including accountability and good governance, conditionalities, monitoring and evaluation of results, etc. The course concludes with a discussion on the scope and limitations of foreign aid and the institutions that implement aid policies. Three hours of instructor-led class per week.\n",

Given its central role in building both individual identity and collective belonging, the current debates on nationalism as pivotal in shaping modern world politics are as relevant as ever. The course starts by defining the main elements and features of nations which serves to contextualize the discourse on nationalism. This will then be followed by a systematic study of the main paradigms of nations and nationalism including the primordialism, perennialism, modernism, and ethno-symbolism paradigms. The course will highlight and compare the most prominent explanations of nationalism and identity-formation. This deep theoretical foundation will help in framing the discourse on nationalism in relation to conflict, paying special attention to the intricate relationship between self-determination, nationalism, and secession.  The final portion of the course will explore normative inquiry of nationalism by asking the all-important question: is nationalism compatible with liberalism? To provide an all-encompassing and balanced study, the course pairs all theoretical discussions with comparative case studies of rising nationalisms across the globe.',\n",
