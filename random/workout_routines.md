#### ( * ) To activate more lats:
Think about pulling with elbows as opposed to hands (hands are just hooks)  
squeeze your traps before starting each movement (similar to bench press); shoulders down and away from ears  
thumbless middle (more biceps) or wide (more scapular) grip  
elbows inwards


#### (1) Anti-shrugs:
On dip machine, raise yourself up relative to your shoulders, try to face upwards.


#### (2) Transpose-shrugs:
*Goal: Involve lower trapezius*  
Hanging 45-ish degrees from vertical (similar to the Y raise, but using all the traps), lift yourself up relative to your shoulders, 
lean back with your neck where your face is facing slightly upwards, imagine your chest bursting out from your spine pushing it. This will additionally 
help with your posture.
