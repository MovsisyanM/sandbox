# Metadata Integration

Metadata integration in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models involves incorporating additional contextual information into the retrieval and generation processes to improve the relevance and accuracy of generated responses. RAG combines retrieval-based methods with generative models, such as transformers, to leverage both specific documents and the language model's ability to generate coherent and contextually appropriate text.

### Steps of Metadata Integration in RAG:
**Metadata Collection**: Collect additional information (metadata) relevant to the documents or context. This can include document titles, authors, publication dates, keywords, categories, or any other structured information.  

**Indexing with Metadata**: When creating the index for retrieval, incorporate the metadata alongside the document contents. This can improve the retrieval process by providing more context for matching queries.  

**Retrieval with Metadata**: During the retrieval phase, use the metadata to filter or rank documents more effectively. For example, a query might prioritize documents published recently or authored by a specific person.  

**Conditioning Generation on Metadata**: During the generation phase, incorporate metadata into the input of the generative model. This can be done by appending metadata to the retrieved document content or by using special tokens to encode metadata information.  


Below is an example that demonstrates how to integrate metadata into a simple RAG setup using Python with a focus on the retrieval process. This example uses FAISS for the retrieval and a pre-trained transformer model for the generation:


This code was generated by chatgpt and hasn't been executed yet, so take it as just pseudocode
```{python}
import faiss
import numpy as np
from transformers import GPT2LMHeadModel, GPT2Tokenizer

# Example documents with metadata
documents = [
    {"text": "Document 1 text", "metadata": {"title": "Title 1", "author": "Author A"}},
    {"text": "Document 2 text", "metadata": {"title": "Title 2", "author": "Author B"}}
]

# Combine text and metadata for indexing
index_data = []
for doc in documents:
    combined_text = f"{doc['text']} [TITLE: {doc['metadata']['title']}] [AUTHOR: {doc['metadata']['author']}]"
    index_data.append(combined_text)

# Create a FAISS index
index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(768)  # Using a 768-dimension space for simplicity

# Assuming we have a function to get embeddings (here using random vectors for simplicity)
def get_embeddings(texts):
    return np.random.randn(len(texts), 768).astype('float32')

embeddings = get_embeddings(index_data)
index.add(embeddings)

# Example query
query = "Example query text"
query_embedding = get_embeddings([query])[0]

# Retrieve the top 1 document
D, I = index.search(np.array([query_embedding]), 1)
retrieved_doc = documents[I[0][0]]

# Use a pre-trained GPT-2 model for generation
tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained('gpt2')
model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained('gpt2')

# Combine retrieved document text and metadata for generation
input_text = f"Context: {retrieved_doc['text']} [TITLE: {retrieved_doc['metadata']['title']}] [AUTHOR: {retrieved_doc['metadata']['author']}] Query: {query}"
input_ids = tokenizer.encode(input_text, return_tensors='pt')

# Generate a response
output_ids = model.generate(input_ids, max_length=50)
response = tokenizer.decode(output_ids[0], skip_special_tokens=True)

print(f"Generated Response: {response}")
```

Explanation:  

**Document Preparation**: Documents are combined with their metadata into a single string for indexing.  

**Index Creation**: FAISS is used to create an index with the combined text and metadata embeddings.  

**Query Embedding**: A query is converted into an embedding to search the FAISS index.
Document Retrieval: The top document is retrieved based on the similarity to the query embedding.  

**Generation**: The retrieved document text and metadata are combined with the query and fed into a pre-trained GPT-2 model to generate a response.  

This example is simplified and uses random vectors for embeddings. In a real-world scenario, you would use embeddings from a model like BERT or another contextual embedding method.
