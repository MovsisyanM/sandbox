In the context of RAGs, both query expansion and query rewriting can be applied to optimize the retrieval step, enhancing the overall performance and relevance of the generated output. Here's how each technique specifically applies to RAGs:

## Query Expansion in RAGs
**Objective**: Improve the retrieval step by broadening the query to include related terms, thereby increasing the chances of retrieving relevant documents from the external knowledge source.  

#### **Approach**:  

- **Synonyms and Related Terms**: Adding synonyms and related terms to the query based on the context of the question or prompt.  
- **Concept Expansion**: Including broader or narrower terms that are conceptually related to the query.  
- **User or Domain-Specific Patterns**: Incorporating terms that are frequently associated with the user's query within a specific domain.  


#### Example:  

- **Original query**: "What is the role of mitochondria?"  
- **Expanded query**: "What is the role of mitochondria, function of mitochondria, energy production in cells"  

#### **Benefits**:  

- **Increased Recal**l: Retrieves more documents that are potentially relevant, even if they don't contain the exact original query terms.  
- **Enhanced Context**: Provides a richer set of information for the generation model to work with, leading to more comprehensive answers.  


#### **Challenges**:

- **Increased Noise**: May retrieve irrelevant documents, reducing precision.  
- **Processing Overhead**: Requires handling and processing a larger set of documents, which can be computationally intensive.  


## Query Rewriting in RAGs
**Objective**: Refine the query to make it clearer and more precise, aligning it better with the indexed documents in the external knowledge source.

#### **Approach**:
- **Typo Correction**: Correcting any spelling mistakes or typographical errors in the query.
- **Normalization**: Converting terms to their canonical forms (e.g., singular/plural forms, standard abbreviations).
- **Disambiguation**: Rephrasing the query to clarify ambiguous terms or structures.
- **Contextual Rephrasing**: Modifying the query based on the context provided by the surrounding text or conversation history.


#### **Example**:
- **Original query**: "Mitochondira energy role"
- **Rewritten query**: "What is the role of mitochondria in energy production?"


#### **Benefits**:  
- **Enhanced Precision**: Improves the alignment of the query with relevant documents, reducing the retrieval of irrelevant content.  
- **Clarified Intent**: Ensures that the query accurately reflects the user's intent, leading to more relevant and useful retrievals.  


#### Challenges:  

- **Complexity**: Requires sophisticated language understanding to accurately rewrite queries without losing the original intent.
- **Potential Misinterpretation**: Risk of altering the query in a way that diverges from the user's actual intent if not done carefully.

### Application in RAGs
In RAGs, both techniques can be employed to optimize the retrieval phase, which is critical for providing the generative model with high-quality context. Hereâ€™s how they can be integrated:

1. **Pre-Retrieval Expansion**:
   - Before retrieving documents, expand the query to include related terms, increasing the pool of potentially relevant documents.
   - This step can be automated using semantic analysis tools or pretrained language models to identify related terms.


2. **Pre-Retrieval Rewriting**:
   - Correct and refine the query to align it better with the indexed documents.
   - This involves spell checking, normalization, and clarifying the intent based on context.

3. **Hybrid Approach**:
   - Combining both techniques can be effective. First, rewrite the query to correct any errors and clarify intent. Then, expand the query to include related terms, ensuring a broad yet precise set of documents for retrieval.


### Example Workflow in a RAG System

1. **User Query**: "Explain mitochondira function"
2. **Query Rewriting**:
   - **Correct typos**: "Explain mitochondria function"
   - **Clarify intent**: "Explain the function of mitochondria in cells"
3. **Query Expansion**:
   - **Add related terms**: "Explain the function of mitochondria in cells, mitochondria role in energy production, cellular respiration"
4. **Document Retrieval**:
   - Retrieve a broad set of documents related to the expanded and refined query.
5. **Generation**:
    - Use the retrieved documents as context to generate a detailed and accurate response.  


By employing both query expansion and query rewriting, RAG systems can significantly enhance the quality of retrieved documents, providing a richer context for the generative model and ultimately delivering more accurate and informative responses.
