### Types of materials

#### Solid materials:
1. [Metals](https://github.com/MovsisyanM/sandbox/blob/main/MaterialsScience/Knowledge.md#metals)
2. Ceramics
3. Polymers

#### Metals
Atoms arranged in a very orderly manner.
Usually made up of metallic elements (iron, aluminum, copper, titanium, gold, nickel) and sometimes also nonmetallic elements (carbon, nitrogen, exygen).
Usually more dense compared to other types.
Are usually [ductile](https://github.com/MovsisyanM/sandbox/blob/main/MaterialsScience/Knowledge.md#ductileductility), stiff, and strong, resistant to fracture.
Have a large number of nonlocalized electrons, thus good conductors of electricity and heat but are not transparent to visible light.
Polish metals are usually lustrous.
Some metals (Fe, Co, Ni) have useful magnetic properties.


#### Ceramics

Compounds between metallic and nonmetallic elements.
Most frequently oxides, nitrides, carbides.
Also traditional ceramics: cement, glass, clay (porcelain).  
Strong, stiff, but are brittle.  
Usually insulators of heat and electricity.  
Resistant to high temperatures.  
Can be transparent, translucent or opaque.  
Some of the oxide veramics can exhibit magnetic behavior ($Fe_3O_4$)


#### Polymers

Materials like plastic and rubber.  
Many are organic, based on C, H, O, N, Si.  
Large molecular structures, often chain-like, backbone of carbons.
Mostly similar to metals mechanically, but not nearly as stiff or strong.  
Low density.  
$\frac{\text{Stiffness/strength}}{mass}$ is comparable to metals and ceramics.  
Many polymers are extremely ductile/pliable.  
Mostly chemically inert and unreactive.  
Tendency to soften/decompose at modest temperatures.  
Low electrical conductivity, nonmagnetic.


#### Composites

Composed of two or more individual materials.
Mostly refers to synthetic materials, but wood and bone are also composites.  


#### Carbide
A compound composed of carbon and a metal.

### Off topic



#### Carbiding/carburizing
The process for producing carbide coatings on a metal piece.
