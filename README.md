# Sandbox

This is a place for me to store all of the code that doesn't belong in a spearate repo. 
You can find my homeworks from the university, or entries into some competition, or just 
scripts that I used once a long time ago. 


This repo is also a practicing arena for my skill development, you can track the development at
[this url](https://viewer.diagrams.net/?tags=%7B%7D&highlight=0000ff&edit=_blank&layers=1&nav=1&title=SkillDevelopment.drawio#Uhttps%3A%2F%2Fdrive.google.com%2Fuc%3Fid%3D1fT1_Vs1rEmWI_sVruAEbLNVG2ZKjzttW%26export%3Ddownload)


Feel free to copy homework answers, but beware, I make a lot of mistakes and I don't put
much effort in them.
