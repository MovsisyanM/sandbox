# Sandbox

This is a place for me to store all of the code that doesn't belong in a spearate repo. 
You can find my homeworks from the university, or entries into some competition, or just 
scripts that I used once a long time ago. Feel free to copy homework answers, but beware, 
I make a lot of mistakes and I don't put much effort in them.
