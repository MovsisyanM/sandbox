    "\n",
    "Answer:  \n",

If $ x $ is an eigenvector of $ A $ with eigenvalue $ \\lambda $, then $ x^T A x = \\lambda x^T x = \\lambda |x|^2 \\geq 0 $. Therefore, if $ \\lambda < 0 $, we have a contradiction. Hence, all eigenvalues of $ A $ must be non-negative.\n",

    "2. Now, let $ A $ be a symmetric matrix with no negative eigenvalues. Consider any non-zero vector $ x $. We can write $ x $ as a linear combination of the eigenvectors of $ A $, $ x = c_1 v_1 + c_2 v_2 + ... + c_n v_n $, where $ c_i $ are scalars and $ v_i $ are eigenvectors of $ A $. Then,\n",

    "\n",
    "Answer:  \n",
    "If a matrix $ A $ has a negative eigenvalue, it is not PSD and $ x^TAx $ can be negative for some values of $ x $. This means that $ g(x) $ is not a convex function and the optimization problem may not have a unique solution, or may not have a solution at all.\n",

    "If, for example, B is a strict subset of the sample space (where b is true) and is a strict superset of C ($ c \\implies b $), when the left-hand part of the statement is true, it does not imply that the information in $ b $ has no effect on $ a $.\n",
